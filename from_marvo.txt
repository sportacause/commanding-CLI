Howdy,
So I’ve done some git practice tonight in anticipation of a busy week with client work and my python courses.
The DS Study Group sounds very cool! Looking forward to hearing how it goes.
Cheers,
Marvo

Will do. Good luck this week. 
Have you already reach loops in your Python learning? 
If you know any of the CLI command for mac, don't hesitate to add as we go.
Best, Cris
